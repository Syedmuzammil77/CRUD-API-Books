in vlsi world, flipflop is a register to store a data for a long time.Latch is triggred by a enable pin it can stay acitve for a entire pulse width(entire clock period) it helps in converging the longest path.
all design in vlsi cant be replaced by a latch. Around 90-95% are flipflops others are latches

Time Borrowing: 
transaprenacy window: 
the latch based designed provided they are on the same phase.
the concpet of latch based is dis-adv to the setup time and doesnt affect to hold time
max borrow time=max.pulse width - datapath delay of the next state - library setup time.
negative Borrow time: 

Setup & Hold: 
MAX delay is for the setup
MIN delay is for the hold
